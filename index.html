    <h1>An Introduction Into Web-Development</h1>

    <p>
    Hello everyone, my name is Ren M. I'm still fairly new to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is my 3rd attempt at web-development. <br>
    I've always found web-development to be quite difficult - even though I am quite proficient in Python, and simple software design. <br>
    I hope this time I can fully grasp web-design and web-development. <br>

    <br>

    Regards, <br>
    Ren <br>
